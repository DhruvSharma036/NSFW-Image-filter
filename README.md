# NSFW-image-filter
This project uses a pre-trained ResNet50 model to create an NSFW image filter that classifies images into adult content and violence. Leveraging transfer learning, it improves classification accuracy by fine-tuning the model with labeled images. Users can mount Google Drive to access the dataset, train the model, and make predictions on new images.
